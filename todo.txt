Issues:

1. The navigation bar will not open on iPhone devices due to the 'hover' event not tracking.
2. The navigation bar is not sufficiently compact for mobile devices.
3. Certain ASCII icons not supported on some laptops (tested on Sony "vpcf12afm")


Todo:

1. Suggested that main site navigation takes place using modal instead of navigation bar on mobile devices.
