Issues:

1. The navigation bar will not open on iPhone devices due to the 'hover' event not tracking.
2. The navigation bar is not sufficiently compact for mobile devices.
3. Certain ASCII icons not supported on some laptops (tested on Sony "vpcf12afm")


Todo:

1. Suggested that main site navigation takes place using modal instead of navigation bar on mobile devices.


Memo's Critique:

- Maybe use a white background

- Contrast font sizes on title page to make main content stand out

- Use less fonts (1 or 2 max)

- Make Buttons & other CTAs clear

- Have a simpler Logo 

- Perhaps use an image instead of background colours
