    <h1>Scriptwise Marketer . co . uk &ndash; Watch this space!</h1>
    <p>In early March of last year (2017) I started working at <a href="https://www.fountainpartnership.co.uk/" target="_blank">this</a> digital marketing company. I realised pretty quickly that I wanted to code, and luckily digital marketing is rammed with tasks that need to be automated, so I set out to teach myself how to do that. The platform I've had the most practice with is AdWords Scripts (using JavaScript), though I have also dabbled with Python (for API work) and C outside of the work context.
      <br/>
      <br/> I'm something of a spreadsheet addict too (this one gets a little complex... : see, Google Sheets is my chosen weapon because of where I work, but I won't begrudge the use of Microsoft's Offering and I'm a bit of a linux fanboy, so I use libreoffice too; you might say I'm software agnostic &ndash; &#128584; &#128585; &#128586;). All this is to say that I have written several scripts and other automations that I'll share in due time, bringing me on to my next point...
      <br/>
      <br/><em><b>I will</em> be unveiling my digital marketing blog this quarter and it'll be at this address: <a href="#">www.scriptwisemarketer.co.uk</a> (the link doesn't take you anywhere, so hold your horses for now). The site  isn't actually built yet... &#128556; but it aspires to be a hub for all types of digital marketing related coding&mdash;Watch This Space!</b>
